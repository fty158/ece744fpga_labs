Introduction 
=======================
This repository contains the `ECE744/ECE742` Lab materials. 

*Notification(important)ï¼š
=======================

For those who are familiar with the FPGA and VHDL, instead of the following four simple experiments, you may choose to do an FIR filter design using VHDL. Details can be found in the folder 'FIRfilter'. 

Directory Structure
=======================
  - BoardSupportPackages: This is to install the board support packages for the NEXYS DDR4 board for VIVADO software tool. Follow the instruction in https://reference.digilentinc.com/vivado/installing-vivado/start (This step is not required since we are only doing the simulation this semester due to the COVID-19)
  - Documents: Some very useful documentations for the lab
  - Labs_CheatSheet: Codes for the labs
  - VHDL Modules: Useful VHDL modules that can be used in the lab

Labs
======================
lab 1 Code Converter
----------
In this lab, you will design and build a simple code converter circuit and simulate it with Vivado. During this laboratory, you will gain experience using the Xilinx Vivado digital circuit development tools.

lab 2 Four-Bit RCA
----------
In this lab, you will design and program a four-bit ripple-carry adder/subtractor circuit using modular design techniques.  All of the necessary VHDL coding concepts and procedures will be introduced in the laboratory and implemented by the experimenter.

lab 8 Traffic Light Logic
----------
In this lab, you will learn how to design Finite State Machines with VHDL. Typically, traffic light control is a field dominated by micro-controllers. Very complex timing of these lights can be handled with some simple software running on off-the-shelf products. For very simple traffic lights, however, it may be possible to implement their timing functionality with simple sequential logic circuits. In this lab, you will design and implement two traffic light controller circuits and simulate it with Vivado.

lab 9 Data Encryption with LSFR
----------
This laboratory experiment will introduce some concepts of data encryption and cryptography and simulate it with Vivado. The student will then be given a set of encrypted ASCII text and will decrypt it using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).

Lab Report
======================
You are going to write a lab report(or four reports seperately) for the four labs through Blackboard. The lab report should include the following sections:

     * Introduction
     * procedures
     * Results
     * Discussion/Conclusion
     * Reference
     * Appendix(code and screenshots)

Academic Honesty
========================
You must acknowledge your work including figures, codes and writings are belonging to you with your signature on the front page of all submitted reports. If any similarity in the code, comments, customized program behavior, report writings and/or figures are found, both the helper (original work) and the requestor (duplicated/modified work) will be called for academic disciplinary action including failure of this course, and student's advisor/department will be notified.
